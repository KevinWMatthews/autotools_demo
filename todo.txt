For some reason having two calls to AC_CHECK_HEADERS() causes the check to stdio.h to throw a warning message when configure is passed --disable-async-exec:
    configure: WARNING: stdio.h: accepted by the compiler, rejected by the preprocessor!
    configure: WARNING: stdio.h: proceeding with the compiler's result
Everything still seems to work fine.
