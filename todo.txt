Update to use:
    AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build-aux])
    AM_SILENT_RULES([yes])

For some reason having two calls to AC_CHECK_HEADERS() causes the check to stdio.h to throw a warning message when configure is passed --disable-async-exec:
    configure: WARNING: stdio.h: accepted by the compiler, rejected by the preprocessor!
    configure: WARNING: stdio.h: proceeding with the compiler's result
Everything still seems to work fine.

Add a demonstration of AC_ARG_WITH
    This allows the user to use options of the form: --with-package/--without-package
    Their selection will be stored in withval.
