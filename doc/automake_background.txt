I think Automake reads Makefiles (Makefile.am?) and generates Makefile.in templates
for the configure script to process.

GNU Coding standards require several files:
    NEWS
    README
    AUTHORS
    ChangeLog
Why don't my other projects require this?


There is quite a bit behind a statement like:
    bin_PROGRAMS
    <prefix>_<primary>


Primaries:
    A product type or product class.
    Examples are:
        PROGRAMS
        SCRIPTS
        PYTHON
        SCRIPTS
        DATA
        JAVA
        MANS
        ...
    Different primaries have different rules for execution and installation.


Prefixes:
    Specifics are defined in the Automake manual and "The GNU Coding Standards".
    Search the AUTOMAKE manual for, say, "PROGRAMS primary".

    Programs can be installed using:
        Prefix      Directory
        ---------------------
        bin_        bindir
        sbin_       sbindir
        libexec_    libexecdir
        noinst_     Do not install
        ...
    Libraries can be installed in:
        Prefix      Directory
        ---------------------
        lib_        libdir
        pkglib_     pkglibdir
        noinst_     Do not install
    Data can be installed in:
        Prefix      Directory
        ---------------------
        data_       datadir
        sysconf_    sysconfdir_
        ...

    There is also:
        check       For target 'make check'
        noinst      Do not install
        EXTRA       Conditionally build. Read about it later.
    
    pkg prefixes have a special meaning that I should read about.


Super prefixes:
    These go before prefixes.

    dist            Should be distributed
    nodist          Do not distribute
    nobase          ?

    These can be combined.



<product>_SOURCES:
    List the source files that we be built into <product>'s executable.
    <product> will depend on these files.
    Private header files can/should be included. "These will be included in the distribution."
    They won't actually be installed; that is done using include_HEADERS (include specifies the installation directory).
    In some cases it is preferable to use noinst_HEADERS, but typically _SOURCES is used.
    Strangely, a missing header file does not cause a configuration or build error.


TODO go read about check_ for 'make check'.


Convenience library:
    A library that our package creates for use by itself. This library is not installed.
    This isn't strictly necessary but it is convenient for enforcing modularity and reducing
    the size of the _SOURCES list.
    Convenience libraries are declared using directory-less prefixes:
        noinst_
        check_
        EXTRA_
    Read about this in: 8.3.5 Libtool Convenience Libraries
