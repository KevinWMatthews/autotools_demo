Autoconf generates a configure script.

The input to Autoconf is:
    shell script with macros.
    The macro language is called m4.
    M4 means "m plus 4 more letters" (macro). Thanks, K&R.

This input file is typically named configure.ac, though in old versions it is named configure.in.

Autoconf usies square brackets [] as a quoting mechanism.
Such quotes aren't always necessary but are safest.

autoscan invokes autom4te on configure.ac.

Autoreconf invokes several other tools:
    Gettext (possibly)
    aclocal
    autom4te  ("automate")
    Autoheader
    Automake

The configure script should:
    perform checks
    generate config.status
    call config.status
    generate config.log

config.status should:
    generate files from templates (text replacement within .in files)
    It can be called to regenerate Makefiles when a template but not the environment has changed.
    This skips the checks in the configure script.

config.log contains:
    configure script info:
        configure command line invocation
        platform info
        core test info
        line number of configure that generates config.status
    config.status info:
        the arguments to config.status
        list of cache variables
        list of output variables
        exit code

Makefiles depend on both Makefile.in on and config.status.

The configure script uses sed and awk to process templates and perform text replacements.
The script *only* touches Autoconf variables, which are denoted with @ as follows:
    @variable_name@
