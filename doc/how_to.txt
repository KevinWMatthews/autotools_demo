To clean all files generated by autotools, you can run
# git clean -fdX        # Force, remove directories, remove only untracked files
to remove all untracked files and directories. This works if your .gitignore file is set just right.

Run:
# autoscan
to help you create and maintain your configure.ac.
It checks for common problems and logs them in two files:
    autoscan.log
    configure.scan

See:
    https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/autoscan-Invocation.html

To execute Autoconf, run:
# autoreconf -v
It is possible to run autoconf, but this won't properly invoke automake and libtool.
To have autoconf run other autotools in verbose mode, run
# autoreconf -vv
The output is very verbose.
