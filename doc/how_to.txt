To clean all files generated by autotools, you can run
# git clean -fdX        # Force, remove directories, remove only untracked files
to remove all untracked files and directories. This works if your .gitignore file is set just right.

Run:
# autoscan
to help you create and maintain your configure.ac.
It checks for common problems and logs them in two files:
    autoscan.log
    configure.scan
In fact, ou can use configure.scan as a basis for your configure.ac file.

See:
    https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/autoscan-Invocation.html

To execute Autoconf, run:
# autoreconf -iv            # --install --verbose
It is important to use the --install flag; this will install programs that are needed.

It is possible to run autoconf, but this won't properly invoke automake and libtool.
To have autoconf run other autotools in verbose mode, run
# autoreconf -vv
The output is very verbose.


Is your project configured for automake? If not, this will fail. You will need to run:
# automake --add-missing --copy

Right now let's package that up in an autogen script. Run:
./autogen.sh

Rather than using automake, this example uses hand-coded Makefile.in files. I wonder why.
Generate Makefiles from their template .in files, using an out-of-tree/VPATH build:
cd build
../configure
