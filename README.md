Introduction to Autotools based on John Calcote's book "Autotools: A Practioner's Guide to Gnu Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool".

This project is designed for an out-of-tree build in the directory build/
To build examples, run:
```bash
cd build
autoreconf -iv ..
../configure
make
```
As with all Autotools projects, you can set the install directory by passing `--prefix=</path/to/install/dir` to the configure script.

The .gitignore file has been designed to specifically ignore all files that are generated by Autotools and the build process.
To remove *all* Autotools files and build results, use:
```bash
git clean -fdX
```
